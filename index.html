    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>I write software that takes HTTP requests and spits out HTTP responses.</strong> It's my very favorite thing.</p>
    <p>Since 2014 I've been doing it at <a href="https://sofi.com">SoFi</a>, where we are eating the lunches of every industry
        that's based on compounding interest. We use the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://playframework.com">Play! 2.5</a>, a JVM web framework, with routing and templating and CSRFing and
            databasing and reactive-ing and all that jazz. Play supports Scala, but I use Java.</li>
        <li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>, a highly opinionated frontend straightjacket</a>
        </li>
        <li>Docker, more specifically <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a>, which allows us to reliably
            manage a bunch of containers and abstract a lot of dependencies away for day-to-day development. <a href="https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/">It's the future</a>,
            except it actually <em>is</em> the future.
            <li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>'s stack for all manner of collaboration, CI and general businessing.
                That means <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, JIRA, Bamboo, HipChat, and Confluence</li>
            <li>We use other technologies, too - you could read all day about Postgres and MySQL and Hibernate and Spring and
                Guice and AWS &amp;c. But mostly, again,

    </ul>
    <p><strong>I write software that takes HTTP requests and spits out HTTP responses.</strong></p>

    <h2>Work History</h2>
    <p>I used to work at <strong><a href="http://www.janusresearch.com/">Janus Research Group</a></strong>. During the first
        half of 2014 I did a little work on "serious games," training software built in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>.
        Before that, I spent two and a half years (2011-2013) writing mostly VBA and C# to automate the creation of spreadsheets
        and UML diagrams for the Army's Intelligence Center of Excellence.</p>
    <p>Before Janus, I worked at <strong><a href="http://www.solomontech.com/">Solomon Technology Solutions</a></strong> for
        a year (2010-2011), doing the same spreadsheets and UML for the same Army</p>
    <p>Before Solomon, I maintained software that took HTTP requests and spat out HTTP responses for <strong><a href="http://www.axiom4.com/">AXIOM IT Solutions</a></strong>        and their customers, from late 2008 through 2010.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Before and during AXIOM, I attended the <strong><a href="http://www.umt.edu/">University of Montana</a></strong>,
            graduating in 2009 with a degree in Math and Computer Science.</p>

        <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
        <p>I volunteer as a mentor with a local <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FIRST Robotics</a> team</p>
        <p>I am a shoot boss with <a href="http://appleseedinfo.org/">Project Appleseed</a></p>
